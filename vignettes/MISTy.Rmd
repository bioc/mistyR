```

The use of MISTy is conceptualized around building a workflow for analysis using four classes of functions:

-   View composition

-   Train models

-   Result processing

-   Plotting

MISTy is designed with the use of pipe operators (for example the operator `%>%` from [magrittr](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html)) to construct a workflow by chaining functions in mind.

```{r setup}
library(MISTy)
```

## View composition

## Train models

## Results processing

## Plotting
