# Introduction

The use of mistyR is conceptualized around building a workflow for analysis of spatial omics data by four classes of functions:

-   View composition

-   Train models

-   Result processing

-   Plotting

To construct a workflow `r Githubpkg("saezlab/mistyR")` is designed with the use of pipe operators (for example the operator `%>%` from `r CRANpkg("magrittr")`) for chaining functions in mind.

When loading `r Githubpkg("saezlab/mistyR")` please consider configuring a `future::multisession()` parallel execution plan. `r Githubpkg("saezlab/mistyR")` will then use all available cores for execution of computationally demanding functions. It is recommended that the user modifies the `future::plan()` according to their needs.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(mistyR)
library(magrittr)
library(future)

plan(multisession)
```

```{r}

```

# View composition
