Description: Multiview Intercellular SpaTial modeling framework (MISTy) is an 
    explainable machine learning framework for knowledge extraction and 
    analysis of single-cell, highly multiplexed, spatially resolved data. 
    MISTy facilitates an in-depth understanding of marker interactions by 
    profiling the intra- and intercellular relationships. MISTy is a flexible 
    framework able to process a custom number of views. Each of these views 
    can describe a different spatial context, i.e., define a relationship 
    among the observed expressions of the markers, such as intracellular 
    regulation or paracrine regulation, but also, the views can also capture 
    cell-type specific relationships, capture relations between functional 
    footprints or focus on relations between different anatomical regions. 
    Each MISTy view is considered as a potential source of variability in the 
    measured marker expressions. Each MISTy view is then analyzed for its 
    contribution to the total expression of each marker and is explained in 
    terms of the interactions with other measurements that led to the observed 
    contribution.
