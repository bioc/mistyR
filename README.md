## Overview

The advancement of technologies for measurement of highly multiplexed spatial data require the development of scalable methods that can leverage the availability of the spatial context. We present MISTy, a flexible, scalable and explainable machine learning framework for the extraction of knowledge and dissection of intercellular interactions. MISTy can dissect different effects, such as those from direct neighbours or those from distant cells. MISTy can be applied to different spatially resolved -omics data with dozens to thousands of markers. We evaluate the performance of MISTy on an in silico dataset and demonstrate its applicability on two breast cancer datasets measured with imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics, respectively. We show the relevance of the information extracted from the broader tissue structure in contrast to the local cellular niche. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of activities of pathways estimated in a spatial context for the analysis of intercellular signaling.
